				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a title="An Introductory Session on John’s Gospel" href="http://www.andrewrozalowsky.com/2012/09/21/an-introductory-session-on-johns-gospel/">mentioned a few days ago</a> that we had our first study on John last week. The <a title="John Study 2 Preview (The Word)" href="http://www.andrewrozalowsky.com/2012/09/23/john-study-2-preview-the-word/">second one</a> will follow this Wednesday evening as we get into the Prologue. I spoke on how to go about interpreting John&#8217;s Gospel and I closed with two items: a hermeneutic of humility and a hermeneutic of faith. Here&#8217;s what I mean by the first.</p>
<p>None of us can claim omniscience, that is, to be all knowing. There is one being in all the universe that can lay claim to that trait, and that&#8217;s God. Necessarily, we as finite human beings are limited in our knowledge.</p>
<p>And think about when we come to trying to understand the all-knowing, all-powerful creator god.</p>
<p>Start by thinking about the thoughts in your mind right now.</p>
<p><em>God knows them all.</em></p>
<p>Now think about how you&#8217;ve been having (I assume!) consistent thoughts all day long on a whole range of items.</p>
<p><em>God knows them all.</em></p>
<p>Now, are you beside someone else? Or were you at some point today? Think about how <em>that</em> person, one other person, has been having their own thought-life all day long as well.</p>
<p><em>God knows all their thoughts too.</em></p>
<p>Now consider that that happened today, all day, with six <em>billion</em> people.</p>
<p><em>God knows all those thoughts too.</em></p>
<p>Now multiply that by each person&#8217;s lifetime of thoughts and those that have gone before us for thousands upon thousands of years (or longer!).</p>
<p><em>God knows them all.</em></p>
<p>Phew&#8230; that&#8217;s <em>a lot</em> of thoughts. And that&#8217;s just thoughts, to say nothing of events and all else. And God knows them all, can recite them all, call them all to mind (or maybe they&#8217;re just there all the time, I don&#8217;t know!). That&#8217;s a BIG God.</p>
<p>And now, come back to just you. Think about how small your thoughts are compared to what God must know. And <em>you </em>are trying to understand <em>him</em>?</p>
<p>Well, I think that calls for a dose of good-ol&#8217; humility, wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>
<p>And appropriately, in Isaiah 55:8-9 (NIV), God says:</p>
<p>“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<br />
neither are your ways my ways,”<br />
declares the Lord.<br />
“As the heavens are higher than the earth,<br />
so are my ways higher than your ways<br />
and my thoughts than your thoughts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Implication? Let&#8217;s be humble about our understanding of God. Let&#8217;s be willing to be wrong. Let&#8217;s be willing to listen to each other and respect each other. Let&#8217;s be willing to come to God&#8217;s Word humbly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It should come as no surprise, but I love to read, research, and write. And to make that reading accessible to me after I&#8217;ve first churned it up in my mind, I&#8217;m trying to develop a workflow for capturing notes and being able to sync them flawlessly between my iPad and iMac for further research and writing. I should have thought about this sooner but thankfully it&#8217;s not too late either.</p>
<p>I wanted to share this website from <a href="http://www.byjohnchandler.com/">John Chandler</a> that is proving exceptionally helpful to me in developing a solid workflow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since becoming a Christian I have loved the study of the Bible. I hated it before, but immediately fell in love with it after. This, I suggest, is the work of the Spirit. But I have to admit, several years into studying the Bible and it being the main passion of my life (in order to seek Jesus), I still find it thoroughly challenging.</p>
<p>I could mention that I find it challenging to follow its worldview in some ways, but that&#8217;s not where I&#8217;m going with these thoughts right now. I find it challenging to discern its meaning.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve grown up holding two fairly conflicting worldviews in tension: that of a sort of &#8216;positivism&#8217; and that of a sort of &#8216;postmodern deconstructionism.&#8217; Positivism essentially means that I look at a text (say, the New Testament) and immediately gain a window onto objective reality and events as they really happened. There is the author and his or her intent and the events which he or she narrates and I can know them objectively. Postmodern deconstruction, on the other hand, essentially sees no authorial intent in the text but rather sees the text as a mirror reflecting back upon the reader their own viewpoints. Somehow I&#8217;ve subconsciously walked these two lines, contradictory though they are. Having not thought through them prior to becoming a Christian and a philosophy major, I&#8217;m sure I just unconsciously applied them at different times as it was convenient to do so.</p>
<p>It seems to me that there are Christians who fall into one of either camp (or both like I somehow did). On the positivist side, Christians sometimes think that the objective meaning of the events and author&#8217;s intent are simply there and easy to ascertain. On the postmodern side, Christians sometimes approach the text in terms of &#8216;what it means to me,&#8217; never asking the historical question. What matters is the reader&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>But the reason I find Bible study so challenging is that meaning is not so simple. In fact, I think both sides have aspects of it right but have absolutized their position into falsehood. Indeed, Christians so often rail against postmodernism as an enemy (usually in favour of an equally non-Christian position, that of modernism) failing to recognize that it has developed in response to things that were left unaccounted for in the prior prevailing worldview (modernism). Yes the pendulum has swung too far to the other extreme, but postmodernism has helped us remember that there is in fact a reader in the reading process that must be taken into account. And that reader brings all sorts of presuppositions and viewpoints to the text they read. Postmodernism&#8217;s failure, however, is that it has lost any anchor, something a Christian should be very cautious about unless abandoning &#8220;God has spoken&#8221; is something desirable.</p>
<p>In responding to postmodernism as Christians, I believe we also need to be careful not to swing the pendulum back again and forget the reader in the process. I have seen, at least in popular discussion, this sort of thing happening.</p>
<p>Navigating these waters is not easy. That, or I&#8217;m just not that bright (entirely possible!). Or, I am sure someone will say I&#8217;m not allowing the Spirit to speak. Well, maybe, but when I look at 4 legitimate Christians and their take on the same text and the differences present, I am persuaded that our mind/thinking plays an important role in the interpretive process. That&#8217;s for another post, and there are good books out there that would show it biblically (both John Piper and Mark Noll have recently written books to this effect).</p>
<p>So, should I despair? No, I think there is a &#8216;middle ground&#8217; or what have you, that doesn&#8217;t succumb to either positivism or deconstructionism. It recognizes there is a reader with presuppositions but it also recognizes that the reader can be shaped by the worldview of the text, produced with some intent that can be (to some degree) obtained. This itself is the content of whole books but it feels good to write some of this out, even if in broad-strokes and so preliminarily.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every so often I get back on a kick and want to memorize the whole New Testament. I think, &#8220;Hey, if I still have several years ahead of me [itself uncertain], it is entirely possible. And how beneficial it would be!&#8221;</p>
<p>The only problem is, I had these sentiments 7 years ago, 4 years ago, 2 years ago, etc. What if I had actually followed through starting 7 years ago? And will I actually follow through now?</p>
<p>On the one hand I shouldn&#8217;t be too hard on myself since my study in the Bible and related disciplines required for detailed study of the Bible (linguistics, biblical languages, hermeneutics, exegesis, theology, etc.) that has gone on since then has prepared me to be a better interpreter of the Bible today. But, what if the whole NT was already sitting there in my head, ready to be chewed on at any moment?</p>
<p>Charles Swindoll has said it well: &#8220;I know of no other single practice in the Christian life more rewarding, practically speaking, than memorizing Scripture&#8230;&#8221; (<em>Growing Strong in the Seasons of Life</em> [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1994], p. 61).</p>
<p>But even if the whole NT seems daunting at the moment, memorizing portions cannot be a waste of time.</p>
<p>A few years ago I wrote up these ten benefits I was finding to memorizing scripture:</p>
<p>1) I’m forced to dig deeper into the wording. Memorizing a sentence requires reading it over many times and saying it over many times.</p>
<p>2) I’m understanding the flow of the author’s arguments much more clearly.</p>
<p>3) Memorizing whole chapters or books is helping me gain context for that whole chapter or book, necessary for understanding the small bits too.</p>
<p>4) I am getting better at cross-referencing Scripture. When I read in 1 Peter 3:1-7 about proper understanding of husbands and wives, immediately my memorization in Ephesians 5:22-33, where it discusses the same subject matter, comes to mind with which to help me interpret.</p>
<p>5) My language learning skills have grown immensely. I’m finding it near impossible to go into a Greek quiz or test and expect to get anything less than 100% because of straight-up memorization.</p>
<p>6) I’m growing more in love with God’s Word as I store it up in my heart.</p>
<p>7) I’m becoming better at combating heresy and I’m becoming more effective as an evangelist.</p>
<p>8) It is growing my thought life and ability to handle more and more difficult texts.</p>
<p>9) It is multiplying my devotional time by allowing me to go through Scripture in my head at any time and meditate on it.</p>
<p>10) And to borrow a reason from John Piper: Conformity to Christ.</p>
<p>There are other benefits but this will suffice for now. These goals are attainable. It just takes time to develop the good habit of sitting down and going for it every day.</p>
