							John 2:1-12 &#8211; Revealed Glory in the First Sign &#8211; The Wedding at Cana						</a>
					</h1>
							</header>
		
			<div class="content">
				<p>The issue of glory has already surfaced in this Gospel. In the Prologue, John says that &#8220;we have seen [the Word's] glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth&#8221; (1:14, TNIV). We have seen that the Word would make known or reveal the Father to us (1:18). And now in this passage Jesus&#8217; glory is said to be revealed to us (2:11).</p>
<p>This first <em>sign</em> is said to have revealed Jesus&#8217; glory so it is fitting that John would include it in his narrative and that it would result in his disciples putting their faith in him, or believing in him (2:11). As previously seen, John&#8217;s purpose (as expressed in 20:30-31) is to show forth Jesus so that his readers would believe in him. This first sign is included for this very reason and it is the first time we see that his disciples &#8216;believe in him&#8217; in that language (though <em>belief</em> is evidenced in Ch. 1 by the new disciples).</p>
<p>So, what is the sign? Jesus and his disciples find themselves invited to a wedding in Cana of Galilee. Jesus&#8217; mother is also there. A problem arises, however; a big no-no in the ancient world (in ours too perhaps): they have run out of wine. The shame on the groom (the one responsible) would be enormous.</p>
<p>The mother of Jesus says to him, &#8220;They have no more wine&#8221; (v. 3). What appears to be a simple statement is understood by Jesus to be some sort of call for him to do something, as evidenced by his response, &#8220;Woman, why do you involve me?&#8230; My hour has not yet come&#8221; (v. 4). His mother next involves the servants at the wedding by saying to them, &#8220;Do whatever he tells you&#8221; (v. 5). Mary (who actually isn&#8217;t named as such) takes the mild rebuke in stride (or a <em>rebuff</em> as Keener calls it) by evidencing trust in what Jesus could do to remedy the situation. It is perhaps possible that Mary has approached Jesus in her first statement about the wine &#8216;on an inside track&#8217; as his mother, but Jesus refuses to be approached by anyone on an inside track.</p>
<p>Jesus&#8217; comment about his &#8216;hour&#8217; is interesting. Jesus pushes back on getting involved since his &#8216;hour has not yet come.&#8217; Throughout this Gospel Jesus speaks about his &#8216;hour,&#8217; almost entirely in reference to the cross. It seems that Jesus would be hastening on the hour by getting himself involved in a way that would reveal his glory. He nonetheless does respond to his mother&#8217;s request and performs this sign. His hour is coming.</p>
<p>After a narrative comment about the stone water jars present, Jesus is quoted again telling the servants what to do. He takes the reigns, telling the servants to fill those jars to the brim with water and then draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet (vv. 7-8). The servants listen to Mary and thereby listen to Jesus and do just as he tells them. The master tastes it and is amazed at the quality of the wine, better than the first, though it was expected that the worse wine would be served after people had already had a little too much of the good stuff. This essentially is the story of the sign.</p>
<p>The narrative comment in v. 6 that I passed over may be significant. The water jars that Jesus uses for the wine are said to be the ones used by the Jews for ceremonial washing. In altering the purpose of these jars Jesus may be setting aside the purificatory rites and setting the shame of the groom needing rectification over against purificatory rites. Indeed there may be connections to the Temple narrative which follows this that I&#8217;ll explore later.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that the road toward Jesus&#8217; hour of the cross has begun and his glory is being revealed resulting in those around him believing in him.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<p>As I study to get back into the John series (John 2:1-11 coming up shortly), I am learning for myself that I don&#8217;t need to read every commentary on a text. There is a place for that if one is working on a scholarly paper but for the purposes of preparing the type of text studies I&#8217;m working on for this blog and for others preparing Bible studies and preaching, too many commentaries just seem to be a drag. I&#8217;m starting to learn which commentaries I&#8217;m most helped by in general and specifically on the Gospel of John. The best first step is always the original text. The last good step is a few helpful commentaries. But having too many of the wrong sort just slow things down unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Perhaps toward the end of the John series on this blog I&#8217;ll review the commentaries I&#8217;ve worked with and provide a judgment of my opinion of their usefulness.</p>

				<p>You&#8217;ll have to take out your pens and correct your English Bibles and gospel tracts with this one! The latest issue of <em>The Expository Times</em> contains an essay by Wally Cirafesi of McMaster Divinity College challenging the translation equivalent, &#8220;to fall/come short,&#8221; for ὑστεροῦνται in Romans 3:23. He shows the over-reliance on the King James rendering (1611) and shows that &#8216;to lack&#8217; would be the better translation equivalent.

			<div class="content">
				<p>In this passage John, the writer, tells of Jesus gaining his first disciples. The first two, Andrew and John (?!), begin to follow Jesus upon the hearing John the Baptist say again, &#8220;Look, the Lamb of God!&#8221; These two disciples were actually disciples of John but due to the faithfulness of John&#8217;s bearing witness to someone greater than himself, the disciples became followers of Jesus. It is clear that the Baptist had no ego and pride to surrender. In fact, later he will say, &#8220;He must become greater, I must become less&#8221; (3:30). The Baptist remained faithful to his mission; the Messiah was pointed out.</p>
<p>At this point the Author relays to us how Simon Peter is brought into the mix. His brother Andrew had already started to follow Jesus but the first thing he did (v. 41) was to go and find Simon and he said to him, &#8220;We have found the Messiah!&#8221; (v. 42) Philip then does the same thing Andrew did with his brother. Philip found Nathanael and told him: &#8220;We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the Prophets also wrote &#8211; Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph&#8221; (v. 44).</p>
<p>I am always amazed at these statements, although as I grow in my understanding of the Bible, they are making more and more sense. Andrew&#8217;s statement, that they had found the Messiah, highlights that they had found the one the Scriptures (the Old Testament) had been promising. God&#8217;s Anointed was now here, and he was found in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. God&#8217;s promises were coming to fulfillment!</p>
<p>Philip&#8217;s statement is similarly amazing but it claims more specifically that Jesus of Nazareth is the very one that was written about by Moses and whom the Prophets also wrote about. That suggests to me that if we go back through the Torah (first 5 books of the Bible, the &#8220;Law&#8221; or &#8220;Instruction&#8221;) and through the Prophets we will see patterns that lead us to this Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>The passage ends with an encounter between Jesus and Nathanael. Nathanael comes to Jesus and Jesus gives information to Nathanael about himself from before they had even met, showing that Jesus had supernatural knowledge of him (vv. 47-48). When Nathanael hears this he explodes with what can only be considered worship: &#8220;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel!&#8221; (v. 49).</p>
<p>Jesus calmly responds: &#8220;You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that. I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man&#8221; (vv. 50-51).</p>
<p>This whole passage is wonderfully littered with claims about who Jesus is. He is addressed as Rabbi, Son of God, King of Israel, Messiah and called the one about whom Moses and the Prophets wrote. He addresses himself as the Son of Man. He accepts all these titles, indicating (as will become evermore clear throughout the Gospel) his identity with the Father, one with God. The disciples don&#8217;t yet have a full understanding of what these titles mean, but they&#8217;re on the right track and speak better than they know. What we know so far is that this man, Jesus of Nazareth, is about to bring to fruition all that has gone on in redemptive history in incredible ways. We will see heaven opened. We will see Jesus&#8217; glory. We will see the glory of God.</p>

							Generosity and Grace						</a>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Since being diagnosed with cancer in December my wife and I have been on the receiving end of a lot of generosity. Our church family has been wonderful as have our blood family, relatives, and friends.</p>
<p>The result of being on the receiving end of such generosity has been to make me desire to be more generous myself. I&#8217;m fairly certain that I&#8217;ve shed more tears as a result of people&#8217;s generosity than I have from the cancer situation itself. I did nothing to deserve anyone&#8217;s generosity and so it hits me emotionally every time.</p>
<p>By God&#8217;s grace this isn&#8217;t a debtors ethic that I&#8217;m carrying around. That is, I don&#8217;t feel I have to pay people back because they have paid me with something. Rather, the grace of others toward me has shown me how beautiful it is to give and has made me want to be that way toward others.</p>
<p>And isn&#8217;t that how it&#8217;s supposed to be with our relationship with God? His grace toward us is not license to sin further or seek to pay him back &#8211; as though God needs anything from us! It compels us and transforms us to love him more and obey out of a joyful and glad heart rather than through strict requirement.</p>
<blockquote><p>What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? Or don&#8217;t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. &#8211; Paul, Romans 6:1-4 (TNIV).</p></blockquote>
