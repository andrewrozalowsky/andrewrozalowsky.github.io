					</h1>
							</header>

			<div class="content">
				<p>I&#8217;m one of those people that has a &#8220;strong testimony&#8221; of conversion. I was saved at 20 while in my second year of university and it includes a time of strong rebellion and hurt and then Jesus breaking in strongly to make me his own. I can point to the exact evening of my conversion and can tell you all about it. Christian friends in university would express excitement but sometimes also jealousy over my story. They would lament that they grew up in a Christian home and can&#8217;t point to a definitive point when they knew they had become a Christian. But Christian they were.</p>
<p>For my story of salvation I am eternally grateful.</p>
<p>But sometimes I wish I had what some of you reading this will have. Since I didn&#8217;t grow up in a Christian home I don&#8217;t have a heritage of family devotions or family discussions of theology. Now that I have my own family I am looking to others to learn how to do family devotions since I have no first hand experience with it. I also have no heritage of studying the Bible through my youth. When I became a Christian at 20 I started to read the Bible really for the first time. With a nominal Catholic background I understood a few things, but I can remember picking up a Bible that a relative had given me when I was younger, starting to read John 1 like I was told, and putting it back on the shelf to collect more dust. It was lifeless to me. So, at 20 I was really starting from the beginning.</p>
<p>I am thankful for my testimony and thankful beyond measure for the story of God&#8217;s grace in my life. But I write this to encourage those who don&#8217;t have the crazy conversion story but have been reared on the Bible and family devotions. Rejoice in that heritage. I wish I had that and I hope to give that to my son.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Today I turn 28.</p>
<p>In the last number of years, especially as a Christian, even though I &#8220;knew&#8221; in the back of my mind that none of us is guaranteed a long life, I didn&#8217;t think much about dying young.</p>
<p>But, when I was diagnosed with Acute Leukemia in December, it only took a day for me to accept that very real possibility. At that point I didn&#8217;t know if I would make it to my 28th birthday. I subsequently went into remission (doesn&#8217;t equal cured) from the chemotherapy but I still don&#8217;t know if I have any more birthdays. Regardless, I see this cancer as a gift.</p>
<p>The reason, I believe, that I was able to come around on the news within a day was this: <em>my theology prepared me for it</em>. What do I mean by that? I mean that I had an understanding of a holy and righteous God, of a sinful human race, of a cursed world, and of a Saviour who bridged the gap between God and us and our world. And, by God&#8217;s grace I trusted in the Saviour, Jesus, to carry me and my family through this. It wasn&#8217;t a real shock then when I was told I had cancer. Sure I cried with my wife when I first got a phone call about the possibility, but I knew that I wasn&#8217;t exempt from the pains of this world.</p>
<p>Allow me to flesh out this theology for you a bit. Three aspects bear special mention.</p>
<p><strong><em>1) The Current State of the World</em></strong></p>
<p>Though God created this world perfect and good, we humans rebelled against God, seeking to be gods ourselves. A righteous and holy God rightfully placed this world under a curse in response. Dare we get away with treason? So, death entered into the world. Our relationship with the One who made us was broken.</p>
<p>Cancer exists now. Hatred exists now. Selfishness exists now. This world is a mess.</p>
<p>As such, I&#8217;m not surprised I have cancer. I&#8217;m a part of this world and not exempt from its pains.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The creation was subjected to futility&#8221; (Romans 8:20).</em></p>
<p>But only knowing this makes me a realist without hope.</p>
<p><strong><em>2) Redemption</em></strong></p>
<p>But God hasn&#8217;t left us alone. Though we could not fix the relationship between God and us (after all, we&#8217;re the rebels!), God continued to act in history to redeem a people for himself. In the Garden he made the first promise that he would reverse the effects of the curse (Genesis 3:15). He entered into covenant with Abraham, promising that from his seed he would bless the nations (Genesis 13:15; Galatians 3:16). He gave the law to Moses to direct the ways of his people, a grace in itself (Exodus; John 1:16). He gave the sacrificial system to show that sin required the shedding of blood (Leviticus). He set David upon the throne of Israel, a man after God&#8217;s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14). His people continued to fight him and so they were exiled for a time in punishment (see the Prophets). But God continued to speak of and promise redemption. Isaiah, the 8th c. B.C. prophet, spoke of the coming exiles for God&#8217;s people but also promised that after that would come one who would suffer and justify many (Isaiah 53:11) and bear &#8220;the sin of many, and [make] intercession for the transgressors&#8221; (Isaiah 53:12). The stage was set.</p>
<p>Then the ultimate act of mercy and grace that was continually promised happened: he sent his Son to die for us. Though you and I deserved his righteous judgment, Jesus was born in the flesh to take our sin upon himself. Two thousand years ago, this Jesus decisively conquered sin and death by being brutally crucified. He satisfied God&#8217;s righteous wrath. The wrath you and I deserved (see Romans 3:21-26). And through this he transforms the hearts of men and women to once again honour their Maker.</p>
<p>In the face of suffering I can rejoice that I have received new life in Christ.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!&#8221; (2 Corinthians 5:17).</em></p>
<p>But, a skeptic might argue, &#8220;positive thinking people&#8221; get through this too. But &#8220;positive thinking&#8221; doesn&#8217;t change reality. There is no future hope in positive thinking since without Christ the best one can hope for is non-existence at death. But with Christ there is future hope.</p>
<p><strong><em>3) Consummation and Glorification</em></strong></p>
<p>One day God will totally and completely bring to consummation what he has already begun: the reverse of the curse and our return to Eden (Revelation 21-22). He will completely remake this earth and we who accept what Jesus has done for us will forever be in his presence. He will glorify us with him (Romans 8:30). This is what we were made for. But even now we can know God, the relationship has been restored.</p>
<p>This is hope, grounded in the cross and resurrection of Christ and the promises of that God for what is still ahead.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us&#8221; (Romans 8:18).</em></p>
<p>The question this poses to all of us is this: How will you respond to this? Will you give your Maker his due? Or will you keep fighting him, denying his work in Jesus all the while living in his world?</p>
<p><strong><em>Suffering is a Gift</em></strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the theology and message I believed before my diagnosis, and the theology and message I believe now. By God&#8217;s grace it changes everything. This Jesus, my Saviour, is completely trustworthy and deserving of full adoration and worship. He is completely sufficient. I know this first hand. And I know this <em>through</em> these trials: painful procedures, feeling unhealthy, getting sick with no immune system, facing the possibility of death, etc.</p>
<p>So, in light of my cancer and knowledge of this fallen world, I listen to and commend to you the words of James, the brother of Jesus: &#8220;Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything&#8221; (James 1:3-5, TNIV).</p>
<p>I know that Jesus is sufficient for all things and this trial is for my good.</p>
<p>It is pure joy. This suffering is a gift. It is for my joy and yours.</p>

							John 1:29-34 &#8211; Further Testimony: The Lamb of God						</a>
					</h1>
							</header>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Whereas John the Baptist would provide testimony of Jesus in his absence, he also provides it in his presence. The day after the interaction with the Jewish leaders (vv. 19, 29), John sees Jesus and announces, &#8220;Look! The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>A popular level book I read this week was quick to heap all sorts of heavy meaning into this clause, placing all our current understanding of the cross as expiatory sacrifice back into it. The result was talking about the Jewish sacrificial system and Jesus&#8217; bloody sacrifice for our sins as the fullest understanding of &#8220;Lamb of God&#8221; in verse 29. But what did John the Baptist understand when he uttered these words? Was it a full blown understanding of Jesus coming to be a sacrificial lamb taking away the sin of the world?</p>
<p>In the first place, when John the Baptist said this it was pre-cross. That is, the death of Jesus on the cross had not yet occurred. And prior to the cross there is ample evidence showing that those around Jesus hadn&#8217;t understood and grasped that Jesus needed to be a suffering Messiah, a sacrifice for the sins of the world. Elsewhere Peter rebukes Jesus upon the prediction that he would be put to death (Matt. 16:22-23). In John&#8217;s Gospel, where we find ourselves, the disciples are slow to get the exact status and mission of Jesus, as in chapter 2 when he says, &#8220;Destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will raise it again.&#8221; The author tells us that it was not until after Jesus had died and raised again that they understood this had to happen from Scripture (2:22). John the Baptist, in Matthew&#8217;s Gospel, sends delegates to Jesus while in prison to ask if Jesus is the Messiah or if he should expect someone else (Matt. 11:2-3).</p>
<p>Having said that, I also think that the author, John, and his readers would have had a fuller understanding of what it meant that Jesus was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world. Knowing the end story (either by reading to the end of the Gospel or by knowing what historically happened) will inevitably and rightly colour a fuller understanding of Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. How did Jesus take on the sin of the world? Through his death on the cross; by being a sacrifice.</p>
<p>So, what then did John the Baptist mean by &#8220;Lamb of God&#8221;? Many suggestions have been offered and to be honest, I&#8217;m not quite if I&#8217;ve got this right and the delay in posting this study has been partly due to my uncertainty. While not the most pressing concern in the book, I also think it is worth thinking about since it would give us a picture of how &#8220;lamb&#8221; language was used prior to the cross of Christ in the early 1st century Jewish culture. But, I am going to admit my uncertainty on this point and move forward, maybe revisiting it later on. Given the Isaianic influence on the book, the servant of Isaiah 53:7 seems a possible allusion, and we can&#8217;t rule out undertones of the Paschal lamb being thought of as a sacrifice in this time period. Craig Keener argues such a point (<em>John</em>, 454). Others argue for an understanding of the Lamb in an apocalyptic sense (cf. e.g., Carson, <em>John</em>, 150).</p>
<p>What else can be profitably said to sum this section up?</p>
<p>John the Baptist, in vv. 29-34, is bearing further witness to who Jesus is with Jesus present. He is pointing out Jesus as the one that he said would come after him but is greater than him. He is bearing witness to Jesus being God&#8217;s Lamb who takes away the sin of the world. This is a significant claim in light of the (correct) assumption that only God could remove sin.</p>
<p>He further testifies (vv. 32-34) that he &#8220;saw the Spirit come down from heaven&#8221; on him and remain and this one would be the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. This one is God&#8217;s Son.* Jesus&#8217; baptism is not recorded in the Fourth Gospel but has already happened by this point. At the baptism John saw the Spirit come down and remain on him and this is what convinced John that Jesus was the one he was looking for. Jesus was the one who would bring the Spirit to God&#8217;s people. With this, the narrative will rightly turn back to a focus on Jesus as the Baptist points him out for such focus.</p>
<p>*There is a textual variant here that I may deal with in a separate post.</p>

							Preparing to Preach &#038; Seminary&#8217;s Purpose						</a>
					</h1>
							</header>

			<div class="content">
				<p>I was encouraged by reading Jim Hamilton&#8217;s post on <a href="http://jimhamilton.info/2012/04/23/what-helps-me-most-as-i-prepare-to-preach/">how he prepares to preach</a> through Jeremiah. What helps him most is&#8230; get ready for it&#8230; God&#8217;s word as given in the Hebrew text. It&#8217;s a good post and helpful in a day where seminaries seem to be dropping the languages rather than ramping them up.</p>
<p>Also on his site is a post about <a href="http://jimhamilton.info/2012/03/26/use-the-right-tool-for-the-right-job-gospel-maturity-for-seminary/">the proper purpose of seminary</a> that is worth reading. It also focuses on issues related to the languages. I found this quotation especially juicy since I&#8217;ve never heard anyone say this so boldly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seminary students who want to learn the Bible in the original languages should take the languages early and often. Why let a semester pass in which you’re not in a Greek or Hebrew class? No one expects to be fluent in Spanish after two semesters. We’re unwise to think that after two semesters we’ll “know Greek.”  You’re at school to <em>begin</em> to learn Greek and Hebrew so you can spend the rest of your life studying the Bible in the original. Why not give all your electives to Greek and Hebrew exegesis classes? There are lots of conference opportunities where you can learn everything from counseling to preaching to evangelism and missions. There will <em>never</em> be a conference for pastors on Hebrew syntax. There will never be a Greek exegesis of 1 Peter conference where you are taught to diagram the Greek text and trace its argument. Get from the seminary what you can only get from the seminary, what the seminary exists to give you. You can get the rest in a good church, in a pastoral internship, or at a conference.</p></blockquote>

				<p>There must be something in the water in Hamilton these days. Whatever it is, I like it. Fellow MacDiv student, Dave Yoon, has started a <a href="http://davidiyoon.wordpress.com/">blog</a>. His first post is a good one, on the <a href="http://davidiyoon.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/the-integrity-of-scholarship/">integrity of scholarship</a>.</p>
