				<p>I find updates to the blog after long absences hard to write but I want to give some sort of update so I can make subsequent postings easier.</p>
<p>Those who have visited my site before may recall I was <a title="A Groaning Creation and a Patient Hope – My Story" href="http://www.andrewrozalowsky.com/2012/11/27/a-groaning-creation-and-a-patient-hope-my-story/">diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in December 2011</a>. I went through four rounds of chemo and remained in remission for quite some time.</p>
<p>While I was in remission I was getting back to work, spending lots of time with family, and I managed to finish my MA coursework very successfully. By mid September 2013 I had hit about 70% of my word count for my thesis and had the opportunity to present some of my work on translation theory at the Ontario/Quebec regional meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society.</p>
<p>But on September 19th I was readmitted to the hospital. The Leukemia returned and I have just spent the last 60 days straight there. I ended up with Pneumonia mid way through and had a really rough go physically. Unfortunately the chemo didn&#8217;t get me into remission so I&#8217;m about to start a new round on Tuesday with that same goal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the blessing of a few days discharged from the hospital to be with family at home before I start this awful next leg of the journey. I anticipate another 40-60 days in hospital for this next round and then I&#8217;ll be moved to Toronto for either a stem-cell transplant (best case scenario, naturally speaking) or a clinical trial if I&#8217;m not in remission after.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the physical update in extremely brief detail.</p>
<p>I have been rejoicing with an inexpressible and glorious joy (see 1 Peter 1:6–9). I have come to know Jesus with a greater intimacy than ever before. He has sustained me and renewed me. He has been my rock and my salvation.</p>
<p>I have used Facebook to update my friends through this process and share my walk with Christ through it. Now that I&#8217;ve broken the ice on the blog (again), I may use this outlet to share more of my journey as the rubber has really hit the road.</p>

							Living Koine Greek Review &#8211; Part 2: Picture Lessons						</a>
					</h1>
							</header>
		
			<div class="content">
				<p>I have thoroughly worked through the <a href="http://www.biblicallanguagecenter.com/books-products/koine-greek/">first part of the BLC Greek materials</a>, which consist of 10 picture lessons on mp4 and an accompanying PDF. (For my first post in this series, see <a title="Living Koine Greek Review – Part 1: My Background and Hopes" href="../../../../2013/04/08/living-koine-greek-review-part-1-my-background-and-hopes/index.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Each lesson is around 14-17 minutes long and cycles through 100 pictures. After every second lesson there is a quiz that tests comprehension of the previous two lessons. The idea is to watch the videos and merely soak up what you are seeing and hearing, becoming familiar with the way the language sounds and making sense of the language itself, all without translation into English.</p>
<p>In the accompanying PDF there is a section that provides some helps for especially tricky parts of speech as you&#8217;re working through listening. I didn&#8217;t have trouble with the Greek because of previous study but in my use of their Hebrew materials I did find them helpful at just the right points where I had trouble making sense of what was being communicated through the picture.</p>
<p>Once the learner has gone through the audio/video lessons, they are encouraged to begin learning how to read Greek by using the reading lessons in conjunction with the pictures. The reading lessons provide all 100 clauses from the picture lesson verbatim.</p>
<p>The PDF advises that the learner is exposed to 270 lexical items and 700 forms that cover a great deal of the grammar of the language. 270 lexical items nearly matches the number you get in an entire year of learning from Mounce&#8217;s grammar, and this is just part one! And the vocab, I would assert, provides a more helpful foundation already for reading widely in Greek since Mounce focuses merely on the most frequently occurring words in the NT (50x+). But if one wants to read profitably in the Greek NT, to say nothing of outside the NT (which should be a goal), then a much greater vocab base is needed than Mounce provides. 25-50 hours is recommended for the picture lessons (I believe the &#8220;500&#8243; number on p. 85 is a typo).</p>
<p>The entire course utilizes a reconstructed pronunciation of Koine and you&#8217;ll need to use it as well. It&#8217;s pleasant to the ear, reads well, and is probably as close as we&#8217;re going to be able to be certain of to how it actually sounded given that we have no recordings of 1st c. speakers! The pronunciation is taught through listening to the audio but is also detailed in the PDF.</p>
<p>The alphabet is taught in the PDF and numbers 1 through 20 are taught in separate picture lessons. Numbers 1 through 10 are drilled in extremely thoroughly as each of the main picture lessons counts them 10 times each for the 100 pictures.</p>
<p>Some assessment of part one:</p>
<p>The first thing to say about this part of the course is that I know Greek better now than I did when I began. Now, just about any disciplined study with time in the language will result in knowing the language better so that first sentence doesn&#8217;t yet say anything positive for the course, though it is helpful to note I didn&#8217;t regress in my learning and I didn&#8217;t stay stagnant!</p>
<p>But, more can and should be said.</p>
<p>I found the videos generally fun which makes language learning enjoyable. I normally don&#8217;t have a problem with finding language learning fun, though I know I&#8217;m the exception and not the norm. But the videos nonetheless gave me a fresh approach to learning vocab and clauses. There were times where I felt they were moving much too slow but that might be a result of my previous study.</p>
<p>The videos engaged more senses than I customarily use in my Greek study. I have always been a proponent of audio learning with Greek, however, and I would record vocab on mp3 for me and my classmates during exegesis courses at school. They helped me study on my commutes to work and enabled me to master the vocab. I have never utilized pictures for Greek study though.</p>
<p>As such, I find the picture lessons to be helpful memory tools. The PDF asserts that more is going on here though: the structure of the language is being drilled in and you&#8217;re learning to understand Greek without translation.</p>
<p>Yes, but.</p>
<p>Yes, you&#8217;re learning without translation. I think that&#8217;s an important goal and one I&#8217;ve sought to achieve through disciplined study of Greek texts, reading more and more and seeking to think in Greek rather than translation. Being able to translate doesn&#8217;t actually show you know the language itself very well. Unfortunately I have lots of criticism of NT scholars that utilize Greek and show they&#8217;ve not sought to understand the attendant linguistic issues or have not moved past notions of one-to-one correspondence between Greek and, say, English. Lots of problems have been created by judging Greek based on English that are really no problem in the Greek.</p>
<p>But, I think there&#8217;s a place for starting with traditional approaches that utilize translation to get you up to speed and then you begin to shed that through reading more and more Greek. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done. I don&#8217;t really translate in my head. I read Greek. If Koine Greek were a real living language—something we cannot actually recover—I&#8217;d be persuaded by the BLC approach. It&#8217;s easy for a picture of a concrete entity, e.g. a camel, with a corresponding concrete noun, to be correctly communicated through &#8220;immersion.&#8221; But this can&#8217;t be sustained as we get into abstract nouns and clause-level/discourse-level meaning and so much more that would have been understood in the 1st c. that cannot be communicated through modern &#8220;immersion&#8221; methods <strong>[update: I wasn't entirely clear here. I'm not saying no abstract nouns can be communicated through immersion; something that is patently false. I'll clarify and address what I believe are the limitations in a separate post]</strong>. I have to think some more on this one and will come back to it in the last post in the series. I welcome your criticism but keep in mind I&#8217;m merely processing out loud. My assessment isn&#8217;t written in stone. At any rate, the senses are engaged in this course and I&#8217;m remembering more Greek as a result.</p>
<p>The materials are well-conceived and I noticed some clear growth once I sat down to read through the lessons and found my reading to be very easy and enjoyable. Lots of thought has gone into the content. Specific registers (or, social situations let&#8217;s say) are focused on at any given time, helpful for the learning process. So, one lesson largely focuses on wine production from the grapes and the vineyard, to the plucking of the grapes, to the carrying of them in the basket to the winepress, to the stomping on the grapes to produce the juice to the fermenting of the grapes in the vats to produce the wine. We learn vocabulary and language in this way rather than by producing word lists in alphabetical order or anything like that. This sure beats trying to learn vocab by memorizing out of a dictionary or frequency list! Another lesson focuses especially on Israeli geography, teaching biblical place names, directions for north, south, east, and west, etc.</p>
<p>The bottom line:</p>
<p>This was a helpful use of time to supplement and grow my understanding of Greek. Recall I am coming at it already having a basis in &#8220;traditional&#8221; approaches (largely) so I need to take account of that. But for those beginning with no prior knowledge, I think that anything that helps a person get into the language is good. Whether it is best is another question that I haven&#8217;t decided upon yet. In the last post in this review I will engage with the pedagogy some more. I do have some big unanswered questions. A hint in the meantime: I&#8217;m really liking the materials so far and will already recommend the picture lessons as a very helpful learning tool though I&#8217;m not 100% convinced by the methodology as a sole approach. I&#8217;ll be in a better place to assess this after working through part 2 of the course. That will be the subject of the next post, hopefully later this summer.</p>

				<p>Last night I had two hours free. I could do anything I wanted. My wife was out and my kids were asleep.</p>
<p>My first inclination when I have &#8220;free time&#8221; is always to read something academic or work on papers. I&#8217;m driven to a fault.</p>
<p>But I purposely decided to watch a documentary on the knuckleball with Tim Wakefield and R. A. Dickey. It had nothing to do with my studies or publishing projects.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t come to this decision easily but I&#8217;ve been learning that I need to relax. Yes there are deadlines coming up for paper submissions. But I have to trust God that he is not bound by me to carry on his kingdom work and that if he wants me to do such and such, he will make it happen as I learn to worship him in both the work (where I&#8217;ll work hard) and the relaxing (where I&#8217;ll relax&#8230; well, hard).</p>
<p>The &#8220;rest&#8221; of watching a movie meant I left the self-imposed burdens of deadlines behind for a night, shed my idolatrous stress, and even learned some things about baseball that will make me a more well-rounded person able to converse with and enjoy more people outside of my little academic bubble.</p>
<p>Rest is good.</p>
<p>But now, back to work.</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/mjtm/volume14.htm"><em>McMaster Journal of Theology and Ministry</em>, volume 14</a>, is growing. It includes a review I wrote of a recent book on Bible translations: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Which-Bible-Translation-Should-Use/dp/143367646X/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1369746916&sr=8-1"><em>Which Bible Translation Should I Use? A Comparison of Four Recent Versions</em>, edited by Andreas J. Köstenberger and David A. Croteau</a>.</p>
<p>I have <a title="Why I Switched to the NIV (Part 1) – A Response to Kevin DeYoung" href="../../../../2012/04/04/why-i-switched-to-the-niv-part-1-a-response-to-kevin-deyoung/index.html">written a bit on the blog before</a> about translation theory and specifically the ESV. In my review I offer some of my brief criticisms (well, raise some questions) of Grudem&#8217;s approach to translation theory for the first time in print. It could seem as though I have a bone to pick with Grudem and the ESV but I just find his essay in the above book and some of the marketing for the ESV to be less than accurate and less than helpful. The other essays didn&#8217;t evidence the same apologetic tone either.</p>
<p>My brief criticism of the general project of biblical scholars toward translation theory is given toward the end. I think we&#8217;re dealing with a false dichotomy (words vs. thoughts) and biblical scholars aren&#8217;t keeping up with modern linguistic advances that should force us to consider how meaning occurs in texts <i>in toto</i>, not merely in words. Discourse analysis needs to be broached.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had conversations with translators on the field (i.e., not biblical scholars but translators) and they don&#8217;t seem to be bogged down in the same discussions we Bible scholars are having in pre-dominantly &#8220;English language translation theory.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also offer my positive thoughts on the book on p. 7 of the review.</p>

							Saying Much and Saying Little – Who I Am Online						</a>
					</h1>

			<div class="content">
				<p>I&#8217;ve been rather silent on the blog for some time with only occasional posts. I don&#8217;t feel the need for an apology but I did want to take this opportunity to reflect on part of the reason for it, since it gets at some things I&#8217;m currently wrestling through.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t always done this, but I want to be slow to speak and say less than I have opportunity to. Part of this derives from a growing desire in me to only say things that I have deeply thought through and worked out. So, there are theological areas that I have been reluctant to say much on since I&#8217;ve only read minimally in them. I don&#8217;t know the counter-arguments and issues.  I haven&#8217;t made up my own mind on them in a thorough sense. But there are areas of biblical studies, for example, where I&#8217;ve thought deeply and for a sustained time and am happy to discuss at length and argue my point, even if I need to be corrected in the end.</p>
<p>Not everyone is of the same persuasion. Nor should everyone be.</p>
<p>But, whatever the persuasion, there are dangers to be aware of and factor in.</p>
<p>On the one side there is the danger of saying too much. With the immediacy of blogs, Facebook, Twitter, etc., it is easy for everyone and their uncle to weigh in on any issue. But there&#8217;s so much poor reading and assigning of bad motives and making assumptions. Everyone suddenly has the authority to pontificate on everything and yet it seems that few have developed the ability to weigh in thoughtfully and critically. I want to avoid this as much as possible which makes me hesitant to say anything.</p>
<p>That, however, leads to the other danger of saying almost nothing at all. I&#8217;ve said little in personal conversations and on Facebook and Twitter about certain cultural battles and my positions on them, for example. Part of that reflects my conscious desire to be seen as positive and centrally about the gospel, not trying to win people on issues through arguments abstracted from seeing a true gospel conversion. But, isn&#8217;t there a place for taking a stand and saying <em>something</em> on various issues connected to the larger culture? Surely there is. And people won&#8217;t like everything I say. I can&#8217;t be a people-pleaser. And there is even a way to engage those cultural issues that are not abstracted from a loving gospel response.</p>
<p>So, there are dangers on both sides. There are different persuasions among us. I&#8217;ve become okay with who I am. I desire to say little but say things I&#8217;ve thought deeply about. One of the consequences of this is that I&#8217;m not putting much time into blogging, daily or otherwise, though I do hope to continue the blog. I am putting more time into publishing essays, articles, and book reviews, academic and popular. And so I&#8217;m using this site partly as a platform for those things as they get published.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thankful for those who are different from me and do contribute lots, maybe through daily blogging or other social media. That&#8217;s good. So long as it&#8217;s thoughtful. Please be thoughtful!</p>
