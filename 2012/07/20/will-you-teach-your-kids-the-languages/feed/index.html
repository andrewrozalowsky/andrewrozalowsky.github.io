		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sitting with my son now and saying, &quot;boker tov,&quot; and asking him how he is in Hebrew. Good idea, David!

I haven&#039;t yet interacted much with the varying views on Greek pedagogy (&quot;The Linguist as Pedagogue&quot; is always checked out at our library! haha ;) I should think some more about it given that I want to teach my son and have taught some adults in the past.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Andy,

I think that Randall Buth and Daniel Street are right to point out that being able to produce a language is a necessary part of actually learning it. So while some of the materials from EKS (such as Og the Terrible and Tale Tales Told and Retold in Biblical Hebrew) can be great aids - you are still going to need to talk with your children in Hebrew or Greek if you want them to learn these languages naturally and well.

This is actually easier to do than it might sound. You can start with expressions like &quot;Boker Tov&quot; and this will just become natural for your children to think that &quot;Boker Tov&quot; is another way of saying &quot;Good Morning&quot;. I would also suggest that you try to focus initial vocabulary acquisition on things that your children see everyday such as dog, tree, table, salt, water, chair, cup, bowl, or common actions like drink, eat, walk, go, come, sleep, smile, laugh, love, etc ... That way you can keep pointing to these things and name or describe them using familiar vocabulary. 

Best wishes,

David]]></description>
