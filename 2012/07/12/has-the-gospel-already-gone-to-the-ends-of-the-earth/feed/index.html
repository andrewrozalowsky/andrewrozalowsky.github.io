		<description><![CDATA[Would all &quot;nations&quot; be all &quot;ethnic/races&quot; instead of &quot;countries&quot;, i.e., &quot;Romans, Greeks, Jews, Asians, Arabs, sub-sahara Africans (along with Tarzan), Barbarians, etc.&quot; ...and thus it could have been fulfilled beginning on/at Pentecost, travels of the apostles, Paul, Barnabus, Mark, &amp; deacons (especially Stephen &amp; Phillip &amp; his daughters). But would they have &quot;missed&quot; some unknown races/tribes in North/South America, Australia, New Zealand, etc? And do we include the Holy Spirit convicting those in unknown places?
  I tend to have more of a future &quot;end times&quot; interpretation because of other passages not related to &quot;all nations&quot;. As long as we forgo making our interpretations dogma, it is an excellent discussion.  I had it many times with Paul Graham on Tuesday mornings.]]></description>
