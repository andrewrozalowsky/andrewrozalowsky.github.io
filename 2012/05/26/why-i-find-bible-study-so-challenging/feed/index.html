		<description><![CDATA[I happened to be writing to someone else about this very section in John&#039;s Gospel and the interpretive process.
&quot;Perhaps the interpretive flow that you like in the Gospel to a large degree flows from sensitivity toward plot, not from pedantic exactitude: it comes from a desire to see, not a desire to count. There’s story there in the Gospels, story about Christ, and detail is story’s handmaiden. Story is all ebb and flow: story leads to plot, plot leads to motive, motive leads to decision, decision leads to consequence—and consequence leads to comparison (as the reader realizes he has been drawn in). Plot isn’t about getting into the mind of the author; it is about the author getting us into the mind of the characters. And, since details are at a premium, every detail is precious.&quot;]]></description>
