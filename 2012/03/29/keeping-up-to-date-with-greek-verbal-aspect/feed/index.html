		<description><![CDATA[Hey there Andrew,

Thanks for writing this post. I think your concerns are certainly valid; I share your distaste for some preacher&#039;s misuse of their limited Greek knowledge.

My Greek professor at seminary highly suggested that we refrain from mentioning anything of the original languages, especially with regards to verb/tense forms. We ought to be able to preach, make the sermon&#039;s point, to communicate in such a way that the lay person can be assured of the clarity of God&#039;s Word.

Pastor&#039;s certainly should keep abreast in biblical scholarship, especially concerning the biblical languages. Amen to that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, the articles look like a bit of post-Easter reading. Then I can decide whether to jump into Con&#039;s other book. 

(Con is preaching for us at our &lt;a href=&quot;gospelforthegong.org/2012/03/19/easter12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gospel for the Gong Good Friday afternoon rally&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;s a public holiday in Australia, so after our own church services in the morning, a number of reformed evangelical churches and ministries are getting together in the afternoon!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandy, 

Con Campbell also has a book about verbal aspect pitched at the introductory level called, Basics of Verbal Aspect in Biblical Greek published by Zondervan. What I find helpful about this book on the introductory level is that it introduces the major players (Porter, McKay, Campbell, Fanning) and their views - where they differ, but most importantly, where they agree. I disagree with his incorporation of Aktionsart (&#039;kind of action&#039;) as a useful pragmatic category but my whole point in the blog was in keeping up with at least where they all agree. 

For a helpful summary of Porter&#039;s view there are two excellent resources. Andy Naselli has written an introduction to verbal aspect in the DBSJ: http://andynaselli.com/wp-content/uploads/2007_verbal_aspect.pdf?9d7bd4
Rod Decker has also written a summary of Porter&#039;s main monograph in verbal aspect: http://ntresources.com/documents/porter.pdf

Actually I&#039;m going to put these in a main blog post. Thanks for asking the question. I hope these resources help.]]></description>
