		<description><![CDATA[My questions was more pointing out to a reference of the OT that wasn&#039;t mentioned in your post. However, you did answer as to why you didn&#039;t look at it.

I understand why now you wouldn&#039;t look at the use of John&#039;s reference. Although, something to consider since the OT Deutero-Canonical books are referenced by Paul 5 times and a few in Matthew and Luke. Since at the time of Christ both the Septuagint and the Masoretic Text were both held in great respect. 

Interesting side note: Since the discovering of the Dead Sea Scrolls, copies of some Biblical books found at Qumran reveal sharp divergences from the Masoretic text. However, scholars were amazed to find that the texts and cannons agreed with the Septuagint. (I digress but say this as a side study to not dismiss the Deutero-Canonical books). Something to think about.

God Bless and keep up the good work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the question, David. 
In the first place I mentioned I&#039;d be brief and deal with OT quotes, allusions, echos, and typology as they arise in the texts. 
Since you asked though, a couple of things could be said. 

John 10:22 says, &quot;Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter....&quot; The text is narrating an event occurring in the life of Jesus, setting the scene for some conflict between Jesus and the authorities at the Temple. It would be saying too much to say John is referring or using 1 Maccabees here. He is only referring to an event that was taking place. The event may find grounding in 1 Maccabees but that&#039;s another question outside the scope of John&#039;s mentioning it.

The next thing I&#039;d say is 1 Maccabees isn&#039;t in the Hebrew canon so that&#039;s why I wouldn&#039;t have dealt with it anyway in my brief study on the OT above.

The last thing I&#039;d say for now is, what question are you asking? You&#039;ve assumed there&#039;s a use of 1 Maccabees but haven&#039;t shown what you think that use is in order for me to comment on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What about John&#039;s use of the Old Testament in John 10:22 which refers to the Deutero-Canonical book of 1 Machabees 4:36, 4:52-59 in regards to the Festival of the Dedication of the Temple?]]></description>
