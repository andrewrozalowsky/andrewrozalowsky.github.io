		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your thoughts Alien. 
While I agree going through Scripture after Scripture for translation comparison is not a bad endeavour to see how it plays out in the real world, the first question that has to be asked to make it worthwhile is, &quot;what makes a good translation?&quot; This is why discussing translation theory, I believe, is the first question since comparing translations and asking which is better is non-sensical unless we can talk about the theories that underlie them. There needs to be a standard. Without that standard the question of which translation is better is all relative. That&#039;s why I won&#039;t spend a lot of time in this series comparing translations in use, only using them where appropriate to illustrate a point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I have no personal connection to Carson so this is just based on my listening to his sermons and lectures. I believe he has used the TNIV for some years (perhaps since it came out) and my guess is he used the NIV84 prior to the release of the TNIV though you&#039;d have to ask him or someone closer to him. I wonder if he now uses the NIV2011 in his preaching or whether he still uses the TNIV.]]></description>
