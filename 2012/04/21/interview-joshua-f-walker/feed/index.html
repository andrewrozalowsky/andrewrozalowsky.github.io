		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

Thanks for the question, but I am afraid you must wait for my dissertation for much more on that topic. I will say that I am applying a particular school of linguistics known as Systemic-Functional Linguistics to the Pauline corpus. Beyond that, I cannot say much more. As I get closer to finishing by dissertation, I might be able to say more, but for now, I am going to hold my cards close. Again, thanks for the question and interest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Josh, would you be willing to share a little more detail on this?

&quot;I am currently working on applying a linguistic method to one of Paul’s letters and seeing the wonderful fruit it bears.&quot;

Thanks.]]></description>
