		<description><![CDATA[This is a great response Andrew. 
Colossians 3:2 “Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on the Earth”. These are interests and passions that set your mind on Jesus, and work you towards the goal of relationship with God. There isn’t anything more beautiful or engaging to study than the Word of God. We all work at different levels, some of us are able to absorb or understand more than others. I know that you have been a resource to me and to the bible study that we were a part of while in Guelph to help us clarify understanding and meaning in certain scriptures.  Scripture study is a help to the church. It helps the body of believers to better understand, know and love the scriptures.
The only time this becomes a problem can be, like you pointed out, when things are taken to extremes and we lose the value of the text. 
I know personally if I have said things in the regard that make light of “bible geeks” it is usually a reflection upon my own insecurities of not understanding something, or being worried about someone judging me for not understanding something and therefore making a comment before someone else does.
My Point? I just wanted to let you know that what you are doing does and HAS been a help to the church body in the past, I know it is now and in the future. So, Thanks!]]></description>
